
At this point, the TODO is more a list of tasks that might be useful and/or
fun to write.

 - Replace a lot of LONGLONG/DWORDLONG with max int types
 - Scroll around input line on tiny windows, where the entire line doesn't
   fit in the window
 - Make more use something like line selection
 - Ctrl+R (reverse history search)
 - Allow pipes to be inserted into tee output
 - Start without elevation prompt
 - Have env read variable value pair from stdin
 - Use CopyFileEx when compressing to eliminate CreateFile?
 - Colorize help and error text
 - More select should use logical line coordinates rather than conhost
   buffer coordinates to allow selection beyond screen size
 - Tab completion on %i
 - Attempt to use dbghelp stack formatting again.  Seems useful for ydbg
   to be able to output the stack of exceptions etc.

 - Support move and resize of libwin windows
 - Maximize/close in libwin
 - Minimize in libwin, implying defining an icon form of a window
 - TreeView
 - Multi-column list
 - Edit reposition viewport after paste
 - Edit horizontal scroll bar
 - Edit parse vim tags

 - Environment variable editor UI
 - TUI start menu - Point & Shoot?
 - System diagnostics

 - Ymake execute preprocessor CreateProcess calls in parallel somehow
 - Ymake dependency aware install, so $(BINDIR) is updated if the link changes

 - Clipboard in hexedit

 - Regedit "rename" values
 - Regedit "rename" keys
 - Regedit search
 - Regedit multi-sz editor

 - Yui should look deeper for background color
 - Win+X menu
 - Start button context menu
 - See how explorer dir show desktop due to elevated
 - Windows 10 taskbar unhides itself very aggressively
 - Yui advertize minimize location for animation rendering
 - Audio mixer/volume tray
 - Safely remove
 - Decrypt bitlocker
 - Disable wifi, apparently not the same as airplane mode
 - Run recent list and autocomplete
 - Desktop context menu
 - Taskbar button progress
 - Progman DDE server
 - Extensible notification icons
 - Yui fullscreen and flash

Longer term, larger things:
 - Port pcre
 - Use regex in hilite
 - Case statement in ys
 - Ctrl+Z
 - Markdown formatter/parser
 - Man or something like it
 - Edit line wrap
 - PWB
 - ASCII art/line drawing/visio
 - Round braces in command parser, including if
